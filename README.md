# Javascript30 Challenge

Each card has a link to different projects.
Some have *amazing* things you can do at them and
others are just **displaying** information in the console.

All projects are built using vanilla javascript
to strengthen my javascript **grip**!

Sometimes these projects are fueled by :coffee: other times some :beer: gets
me through it!
